 <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to list some of the more common plants that you would see in San Francisco.<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;You will find that many of the plants that you see around the city are actually not<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;native to the Bay Area, yet are associated as though they are.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tasmanian blue gum, Eucalyptus globulus, is an impressive tree.<br> 
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Tall, twisted, multi colored bark, with white flowers like sea anemones, blue gum<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;eucalyptus are associated with the San Francisco Bay area,<br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;irregardless of it being native to Australlia.<br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;They love the climate, and many were planted either for timber or<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;for scenery from the 1850s onwards.</p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ice Plant, also known as Hottentot Fig, was originally used along highways to stabilize<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;blowing dunes, and is native to South Africa. The plant is everywhere along the coast.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;They are a low lying shruby plant with bright pink, white, and yellow flowers. 
                </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea Cliff Buckwheat is one of my favorite native plants in the Bay.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;It has an overall silvery appearance with with fluffy pink to white flower clusters<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;that sit atop thin tall stocks. You can see them in places likes Lands End and Fort Funston.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coastal Redwoods are the giants of our coasts. These incredible trees are native to<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;the west coast and the furry red bark and finely needled green leaves make them standout.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;You can see them throughout Golden Gate Park.</p>
