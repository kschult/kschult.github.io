        <h2>My favorite park in San Francisco</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>A brief history of the park</h3>
            
<p>What is now called Lands End was lived on and cared for by the Yelamu Ohlone tribe prior to Spanish colonisation.<br>
    When the Gold Rush came to San Francisco it changed the city dramatically. Buildings like the Cliffhouse and <br> 
    Sutro Baths became part of this changing landscape on the outer edge of the city.<br> Adolph Sutro even constructed a passenger steam train from downtown to Lands Ends.<br>
    During this time a vein of bituminous coal was discovered on Sutro's land.<br> 
    Sutro had a tunnel dug 200 feet under the railroad track and confirmed the find.<br>
    The remants of the train tracks and mine can still be seen in the park today.</p>

 <h3>Places to check out along the trails</h3>           
            
            <p>There is a beautiful stone labrinth created by San Francisco Artist Eduardo      Aguilera on an outcropping of land overlooking the sea.<br>
                The entrance is off a side trail at about the halfway point on the stretch of the main trail that wraps around the coast.<br>
                There is a wooden trail marker for eagles point that will greet you when you find the spot.<br>
                It is laid out on this beautiful vista and is worth the hike down some serious stairs to get there. </p>
<p>One of the most well known spots along this trail is the remains of Sutro Baths.<br> Created by Adolph Sutro in 1896. it was the largest indoor bath of its kind at the time.<br>
    A fire destroyed it in 1966, but remains of the site are still there, and easily accessed.<br> There are many passageways and a tunnel that you can walk through.<br>
    Make sure you are careful though, the site is in a state of deterioration and the concrete and metal that is exposed can be dangerous. </p>
<p>This next point of interest I have never explored. Although I am curious about it. As mentioned above, there is a coal mine long since abandoned on the parks property.<br>
    Getting there is no easy feat though, and only the most careful and experianced explorer could tackle it, I imagine.<br>
    The mine is located 200 feet down from the ominously named deadman's point that is really only accesible by treading water.<br>
    It is mostly eroded these days due to landslides and it's broken up into three different sections.</p>

            <h3>The Flora and Fauna</h3>
This park is wild in the best way. You will not see mowed grass or playgrounds here. <br>
            The plants and animals that reside here are mostly native and left to thrive.<br>
            Here are few inhabitants you might see in this beautiful place.
            <p> The Monterey Cypress is one of the most recognizable trees in the park and only found naturally on the central coast of California.<br>
            They have wildy twisted greyish brown wood and leaves that grow in dense sprays that are bright green, and have a citrusy aroma when crushed.<br>
                The twisting and flat topped look of the trees is the result of strong winds along the coastal range and create really incredible shapes.<p/> 
            <p>Ruler of the skys, the Red Tailed Hawk. They are found through out San Francisco and stay here all year along. <br>
            The Raptors particularly love Sutro Heights and you can see them nesting in the trees facing the Cliff House.<br>
                They have a very hypnotic high pitched distinctive cry, and beautiful mottled reddish brown and white feathers.<br>
